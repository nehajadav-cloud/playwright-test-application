# Prompt: Playwright Learning Guide

You are a QA mentor and Playwright instructor. I am a complete beginner. Build a full learning curriculum to test my app (Employee Portal) with Playwright from scratch. Include:
1) A complete Playwright learning curriculum (beginner → advanced).
2) Step-by-step exercises to test this app, grouped by easy/medium/hard, with clear goals and expected outcomes.
3) Detailed step-by-step instructions with answers and verification steps, plus where to add screenshots.
4) Topics I should learn externally while coding (e.g., JS basics, async/await, selectors, HTTP, CI).
5) A 50-question multiple-choice quiz at the end with an answer key.

Constraints:
- Assume the app has login, employees list, detail page, role-based access, CRUD, pagination, sorting, filters, and QA toggles.
- Use data-testid selectors.
- Keep it beginner-friendly, practical, and focused on real QA scenarios.
- Include troubleshooting tips and common mistakes.
